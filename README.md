# Simple Wars

Simple Wars is a 2D turn-based strategy game developed in the Unity3D Game Engine. The game was a group project for the introduction to Software Engineering course at CSU Fresno. The game is an attempt to clone the amazing Game Boy Advance game "Advanced Wars". The project was largely an effort to learn more about the Unity game engine and game development, in general.

You can download the game on Itch: [https://photoperiod.itch.io/simple-wars](https://photoperiod.itch.io/simple-wars)
